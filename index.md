Day 45 since I started my Python course in Udemy with [Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). In fact, it is more like day 62 :sob: because it wasn't exactly 1 day per chapter kind of learning. 

There were ups and downs in the process but I am so glad to be at the midpoint of the course and learned so much from fun projects such as building the classic Pong Game and Tutle-Crossing with TKinter 🐢, dreaming about OOP, doing fancy codes with list comprehension, making API requests to track my bad habits or to look for cheap flights to Bali🛫. 

I have been itching to to create my own blog to journal my thoughts so why not try it on GitHub as a wiseman told me? That wiseman was my husband. Stay tuned and I hope you will enjoy what you will be reading here.
